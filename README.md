# Simple express tutorial to parse the request params

This project shows a simple express server serving a single HTML page and using `express.static` to serve static files.

Here I have some examples to parse the request parameters to Float and then send the response as output.Response only supports string as a response.

parseFloat() - This method is used to parse the variable inside the brace to a float and returns it.

toString() - this method parses any variable to string where it is attached.
